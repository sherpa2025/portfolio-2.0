    "description": "Unity Valley is designed as an interconnected community where various building types, such as high and low-income housing, commercial spaces, parks, apartments, and transit areas, work together. The goal was to create a balanced site plan that provides easy access to amenities, diverse housing options, and a connection to nature, while considering factors like traffic flow and views.",

    "summary": "The task was to develop a site plan that integrates these elements effectively. I built upon the third iteration of the bubble diagram to position high-income housing near commercial areas, parks, and transit for easy access. Mixed-use spaces were placed on both the west and east sides for varied housing options and scenic views. Public spaces were centrally located to connect residents with nature, and low-income housing was placed near the creek for scenic views. The busy street was positioned on the north side to manage traffic near commercial and transit hubs. The site plan was layered by building types and street lines to assess accessibility and interaction between spaces. This approach resulted in a well-integrated site plan that balances functional needs, accessibility, and visual appeal.",

    "description": "I engaged in the campus rendering process, aiming to improve my skills in Rhino while experimenting with color combinations. Inspired by anime’s clean and vibrant rendering style, I wanted to apply a similar aesthetic to my project. However, choosing the right colors was challenging, causing initial frustration as I struggled to create visually appealing combinations.",

    "description": "The project was focused on designing a space that promotes diversity and inclusion at CU, a university with many international students who may face challenges in connecting with others. The goal was to create a design that encourages interaction, cultural exchange, and a sense of belonging through thoughtfully organized spaces. The task was to design large, medium, and small spaces that support different types of gatherings and activities, with an emphasis on creating an inviting environment for students from diverse backgrounds.",

    "summary": "To address the diversity issue, I created a large gathering space for cultural events, which would help students from different countries interact and engage with each other. The medium spaces, one with nature and the other symbolized by a green line, were designed to connect people, offer relaxation, and provide an environment conducive to both studying and socializing. The medium space with nature and the green line served as bridges between the large and smaller spaces, promoting accessibility and a sense of unity. By focusing on visual details like plants, trees, and grass, the model highlighted the inviting and calming nature of the space. The result was a design that fosters community, connection, and engagement, helping international students feel more involved and supported.",

    "description": "The project involved designing a table lamp with a focus on precision in measurement and detailed design. The task was to create an accurate model of the lamp by sketching each part, taking precise measurements (including the wire), and generating 3D model photos from multiple perspectives. The goal was to enhance my knowledge of design accuracy and how to represent a product through careful measurements and detailed modeling.",

    "summary": "I started by sketching each component of the lamp, ensuring that measurements were precise to ensure correct fitting and functionality. I paid special attention to the wire dimensions, ensuring proper sizing for realistic use. Using these sketches and measurements, I built a 3D model of the lamp, showing it from various angles such as the whole lamp, adapter, top, front close-up, side, and back views. This helped emphasize the importance of precision in product design and improved my understanding of the connection between measurement and modeling. The result was a thorough and accurate representation of the lamp, demonstrating both technical skill and attention to detail, enhancing students' knowledge in design and modeling practices.",

The design brief questioned how to achieve a balance that avoids extremes in brightness—ensuring comfort while adding coziness and happiness to a space. My task was to conceptualize and develop a \"mountain\" lamp that embodies these qualities, incorporating personal significance into its design while meeting technical and aesthetic requirements.",

    "summary": "I embarked on the project by experimenting with various design elements and materials, ultimately choosing laser cutting to achieve the intricate details necessary for the mountain lamp. Although the laser cutting process was time-consuming and presented its own set of challenges, it allowed for a high level of precision and personal expression in the final design. The result is a unique luminaire that radiates a warm, inviting glow, successfully marrying technical precision with a sense of personal significance, and ultimately adding both coziness and happiness to the intended space.",
